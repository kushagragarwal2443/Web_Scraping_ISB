"Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav share space in hoardings",17/3/2018,city,"LUCKNOW: After BJP's defeat in UP bypolls, the new found bonhomie between SP and BSP leadership has now made it to huge hoardings that came up in Lucknow on Friday morning. The hoardings made history as photographs of Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav have appeared together for the first time. The hoardings also feature pictures of Mulayam Singh Yadav and Kanshi Ram, the founders of SP and BSP, respectively. Some of the hoardings were put up right outside the SP headquarters on Vikramaditya Marg. On the face of it, the hoardings are all about congratulating the SP candidates who won the bypolls. But political observers believe that coming a day after SP chief Akhilesh Yadav issued a statement extending his wishes on the birth anniversary of Kanshi Ram, there is much more to the hoardings than mere photographs and congratulatory messages.""The hoarding has come up right outside SP headquarters which means it has the approval of the party leadership. Besides, all care has been taken to ensure that the BSP chief is given a respectable space on it with a photograph which is larger than that of Akhilesh,"" pointed out a political observer. The man behind the hoardings, Tariq Ahmad Lari says the publicity material only reflects the feelings of the party workers in SP and BSP. ""Party workers at the ground level, on both the sides, are convinced that coming together of the two parties was crucial in the present political scenario to check the saffron surge,"" he told TOI, adding that the party workers are looking up to their respective leaders to make the next move.

Spreading positivity with the music of Idam Premam Jeevanam,14/3/2018,city,"For a debutant, director Raghavanka Prabhu is remarkably clear about the elements he wants to be a part of his film, Idam Premam Jeevanam, especially in terms of the music. He roped in composer Judah Sandhy, who is fresh from the success of his film #Chamak, to provide a new sound and feel for the songs and background score.
“The soundtrack of the film has five songs, each of which has its own story, with lyrics that spread positivity and happiness. Personally, I think that Idam Premam Jeevanam has one of the most comprehensive and soothing albums in recent times and Judah has truly woven his magic,” says Raghavanka. The title track, called Life Anthem, penned by Hriday Shiva, has a retro feel to it, while Yeah Turning Point, written by Raghavanka himself, will be a mirror to every engineering graduate, says the filmmaker. Arare Arare and the Travel song, also written by Hriday, are numbers with upbeat beats.
The director’s personal favourite, though, is the Appa Amma song, penned by Abhi Kanasina Kavana, which Raghavanka says will go down as one of the best songs about parents in Sandalwood, after, of course, the Appa I Love You song from Chowka.
The songs apart, the film’s background score is also a highlight, says Raghavanka, adding that Judah’s work is a marked departure from what has been seen and heard in most Kannada films.

World Heritage City open for trek through ages,17/3/2018,city,"AHMEDABAD: The beauty of the living museum — the Walled City of Ahmedabad — and many of its six century old ASI protected monuments is breathtaking, but the significanceof oldAhmedabadrecognized by Unesco as India’s first World Heritage Site — lies beyond the physical beauty of its architectural heritage. It lies in its historical symbolism of religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence. On Saturday, when Gujarat governor O P Kohli launches the Times Passion Trail from Lal Darwaza, the 47 participants who will be part of this trail from all walks of life will engage in a visual dialogue with Ahmedabad’s history. Chief secretary J N Singh, principal secretary, S J Haider, MD Gujarat tourism Jenu Devan, principal secretary industries and mines, Manoj Das, will be among dignitaries who will be present to launch the Times Passion Trail.

With the help of the Walled City’s trusted lieutenants, both rich and poor, Bapu waged a war against untouchability, introduced the city to the concepts of Sarvodaya and trusteeship to help liberate the self from human pettiness and the British. In the many pols— residential communities — also remain stirring tales from the golden age of Gujarati pioneers; from their profitable voyages, overseas totheir effortsin establishing industries and business-friendly systems which today power Gujarat. Ashoka fellow and conservation architect and expert Debashish Nayak says, “The harmony the old city embraces through its diversity narrates a story of religious and cultural exchange.” The ASI has been playing a pivotal role in maintaining the sanctity of the monuments as well as nurturing the city’s character of a ‘living museum’. Mayor Gautam Shah said, “The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) pioneered the heritage conservation when it launched the heritage walk in 1997.” "
ET Women’s Forum to focus on empowerment,15/3/2018,city,"It is quite hard to pinpoint exactly when the narrative of gender equality discussions turned. But that it has turned significantly is no doubt at all. Initially, much of these discussions revolved around why women need more opportunities and less barriers. This was for the sake of the women themselves. But now, gender equality has also become a strategic imperative. Countries and companies alike are coming to the realisation that without truly empowering women, they can never realise their full growth potential. International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde recently declared that if India’s women participate in the workforce as much as men, its GDP could expand by 27%. Lagarde was part of the all women co-chairs of the World Economic Forum (WEF). JSW Foundation chairperson Sangita Jindal wrote in a recent column, “Women are now essential to the bottom line. That alone is why Indian organisations need to be proactive in employing more women and promoting — or holding on to — the ones they already have to positions of leadership.” It is in this context of nation building that The Economic Times will unveil the ET Women’s Forum this Friday. The day-long thinktank cum extravaganza is designed to collaboratively create an urgent, sustainable and national culture of empowering India’s half a billion women. About 50 speakers — including Cherie Blair, Andrea Jung, Yashodhara Raje Scindia, Kristina Jullum Hagen, Fawzia Koofi, M Damodaran, Rajan Anandan, Shobana Kamineni, Annette Dixon, Ekta Kapoor and Alankrita Shrivastava — will discuss ways to empower India’s women along with an audience of over 350 men and women. Cherie Blair, founder of the Cherie Blair foundation and wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, said, “Achieving gender equality in India would have a larger economic impact here than in any other region in the world.” She is one of the two inaugural speakers at the ET Women’s Forum. “India’s low level of female workforce participation can be reversed if more Indian women are encouraged to take up entrepreneurship,” she added. About a dozen talks and key panels in the fields of politics, entrepreneurship, management, professions, workforce, industry, entertainment and sports will brainstorm ways to empower women to take their rightful place in all walks of life. Many initiatives are already under way. The government is doing some — launching the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana. It has also made it mandatory to provide a 26-week maternity leave. The ET Women’s Forum hopes to seed and water many more new ideas and conversations around facilitating greater participation and reducing gender inequality in every sphere of life, work and play. "
Govt makes Gujarati compulsory in all schools,15/3/2018,city,"AHMEDABAD: In a major decision aimed at promoting Gujarati language, the state government on Wednesday announced that Gujarati will be introduced as a compulsory language in classes 1 and 2 from the academic year 2018-19. Teaching of the language will be mandatory in schools affiliated with different boards including CBSE, ICSE and international boards as well as English medium schools.State education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said that from academic year beginning June 2018-19, Gujarati will be introduced as a introductory language in classes 1 and 2 wherein basics will be taught. After that, the language will be made compulsory in classes 3-8 in a phased manner. “The move will increase pride in Gujarati as a language as all children studying in Gujarat will be conversant with the local language. The state has taken a cue from most states across India where local language is compulsorily taught in primary schools,” said Chudasama. The education minister added, “The decision will also help improve the standard of language in the state as it is a matter of grave concern that a large number of local students fail in Gujarati language paper in class X.” It needs mention that on an average 20% of the 10 lakh-odd students who appear for SSC boards have failed in Gujarati language paper in the past few years. Currently, Gujarati is introduced as a subject from class 5 in English medium schools affiliated with Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) while it is offered as an optional subject in CBSE schools in classes 5-10. In ICSE schools, Gujarati is taught as an optional subject in classes 6-10. School managements welcomed the move. “We believe that students in Gujarat should learn to read and write Gujarati language. In fact, even in our international school, we teach Gujarati subject in classes 3-8,” said MP Chandran, president of Association of Progressive Schools in Ahmedabad. President of the Matrubhasha Abhiyaan organization that had sometime back filed a PIL in Gujarat high court seeking promotion of Gujarati language including introducing it as a mandatory subject in primary schools said: “This will help promote the language among not only Gujarati but also non-Gujarati students. We believe that if a child learns mother tongue at the onset of schooling, he or she is able to express herself better. Language is as important as science”. "

It is only a stage. We assess ourselves through it. In 2019, we should get a government which holds a positive outlook on the country’s development, which will provide protection to the interests of the country and one that will present a good picture of India to the international community. Thankfully, the people of this country have already elected such a government in 2014, that working under theleadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. There should be no confusion about the fact that BJP will form government again in 2019 and we will 80 out of 80 seats in UP,” he said. "
Power subsidy to agriculture continue: CM Amarinder,15/3/2018,city,"NAKODAR (JALANDHAR): Chief minister Amarinder Singh reiterated his government’s resolve to continue free power to agriculture and accused the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) of spreading canards to mislead people. The chief minister was speaking at a debt waiver function organised in Nakodar town of Jalandhar district on Wednesday. On the occasion, he distributed debt waiver certificates worth Rs 162 crore among 29,192 farmers of five districts of Punjab. Underlining the looming problem of water crisis, especially the severe depletion of groundwater, he said his government had only provided meters to 900 of the 13.5 lakh tubewells in Punjab as part of a research project. The move was aimed at saving groundwater while ensuring that farmers also get an incentive in the form of cash for their personal use, he said. Explaining the project further, Amarinder said if a farmer was given Rs 10,000 for power consumption of his tubewell and he ended up spending Rs 7,000, the remaining amount would go into his pocket and he would also contribute to saving the declining groundwater level in the state. “This would save both water and power and also benefit the farmer but the Akalis have been spreading canards among farmers when they themselves failed to address the issue of depleting underground water table or improving the lot of farmers,” he said. He said Punjab had abundant water 50 years ago but if the current cropping patterns and other practices related to use of water continued, the state would turn into a desert. Stating that new agriculture policy would be announced soon, he said Punjab needed to have new crops. The CM also attacked BJP for not implementing Swaminathan commission report on fair prices for crops as promised by the ruling party at the Centre. “This report should be implemented in totality,” he said. Amarinder also questioned Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s silence when BJP-led government in Delhi was failing the farmers of the country. Farmers from districts of Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Ludhiana, Fazilka and Ferozepur had converged here for the function held at grain market to get their loan waiver certificates. Describing the distribution of certificates as part of the fulfilment of Congress’s poll promise, Amarinder assured the he was totally committed to implementing the promise of debt waiver. “Things are improving, the number of suicides has come down since the Congress took over,” he claimed. Speaking on the occasion, he also raised the issue of Akalis purchasing buses in BJP-ruled Himachal Pradesh. He said Akalis had started purchasing and plying new buses in Himachal after the BJP took the reigns in the neighbouring state. "

The gender must be self-declaration,” said Sreemayi, adding that the order was against transgender policy. Transgender activists said that they would contact TG cell to make necessary changes in the order.

RBI had asked lenders to check SWIFT network: Rajan,15/3/2018,city,"MUMBAI: Breaking his silence on the PNB scam, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said the central bank, during his tenure, had asked lenders to take action on vulnerabilities in their operation of the SWIFT network. The RBI had also sent a list of bank frauds to the Prime Minister’s Office seeking joint action by banking investigators and enforcement authorities. Rajan, however, did not elaborate which Prime Minister the list was sent to nor if there was any action taken. “When a way is discovered ... for example, with the SWIFT system it was the problem at Bangladesh Bank which unearthed the problems that were there. When the problem is discovered, it is important that the regulators send the message to the banks that we have unearthed this problem, now fix it in your systems. If they haven’t, we have to understand why the banks didn’t,” Rajan said in an interview to CNBC TV18. SWIFT provides a network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about transactions in a secure, standardised and reliable environment. On frauds, Rajan said the RBI’s main concern was that even after scams are unearthed, culprits are never brought to book. “We said we need to bring together all the people involved both in unearthing as well as investigating and see how we can move forward. So, we sent a list of the big frauds to the Prime Minister’s Office to try and get some action on that.” Rajan said that the PNB fraud threw up several questions: Why was this letter of undertaking (LoU) given? Why was it not recorded in the banking system? Did management take notice of it? Was it put before the board? And, of course, after that did auditors pick it up? If not, why didn’t they pick it up as auditors go branch by branch? Were the regulators’ instructions obeyed over time or were they not? And, why were they not obeyed? He added that since the owner in this case was the government, which appoints board members as well as the management, another question is what is their culpability in the whole thing? Rajan also said that guarantees received a cavalier treatment in India — whether it is a bank-given guarantee or a government-given one. “We don’t think these are real. It is only when they are called upon by the entity that has relied on them, we understand it is almost like giving a loan or, in fact more, because it is usually called upon when the loan is in distress,” said Rajan. According to him, providing a guarantee is like giving an equity. “Unless we account for these properly, there are huge contingent liabilities on the government balance sheet as well as on the bank’s, and it is important that we acknowledge them,” he said. On the 80:20 gold import scheme, Rajan said “objective criteria” was followed in liberalising the scheme in May 2014 when the government was in transition. “Our job was to see is this done in a reasonable way.

Apart from winning medals, both have been selected for the National Level Judo Championship matches, which will be played in Jalandhar (PAP Sports Ground) from March 27 to 30. Even though there are seven more city-based girl judokas who showcased the best of their performances, making the district proud in the state meet, they failed to secure a berth in the national squad for further matches.

Aman had this to say about her ambition in the sports arena: “Kavita and I were selected for national level tournament matches, where we have to fight with all prominent sports personalities of countries (related to judo games) to qualify for the Asian Championship trials which fall in the middle of April. We have secured gold medals for the second consecutive time in the state meet, but this time, it will come on the occasion of International Women’s Day, so it’s a little more special for us.” Kavita added: “The message we would like to convey to society through our achievement is that families of girls who still think judo is not a sport for girls should change their mindset, as modern girls do better than boys in many sports events. We both are a perfect example of that.” Coach Parveen Thakur said: “The level of confidence which both have built up on their own is extra-ordinary, and we are sure one day they will make the nation proud in the Asian and Commonwealth Games, due to their hard work and dedication.” "

Congress has betrayed state: Sukhbir at ‘pol khol’ rally,9/3/2018,city,"LUDHIANA (KOOM KALAN): Taking a dig at the Congress government in the state, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal has alleged that Gandhi family had always committed atrocities and injustice with the people of Punjab whether be it Operation Bluestar or the Sikh riots of 1984. Sukhbir said despite all this, people of Punjab had given a chance to the Congress government this time but now every sector is feeling betrayed and cheated. The SAD president said this while addressing a gathering at a ‘Pol khol’ rally organized by SAD MLA Sharanjit Singh Dhillon in Koom Kalan on Thursday. He also said that the party workers would gherao Punjab assembly on March 20 against the state government for not fulfilling its promises. Sukhbir also condemned the Congress government for the allegation it had raised on the youth of Punjab by saying that 70% of them were drug addicts. He also questioned whether after coming into power the Congress leaders had caught hold of some big drug peddlers or smugglers in the state. Sukhbir said the Congress as well as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders gave such statements just to defame Punjab and the SAD so that they could come into power. The SAD chief added that it was condemnable that the Congress government aimed to start old age pension and Shagun scheme from January 2018 this year even though these benefits were pending since more than one year now. He said the SAD would gherao the assembly on March 20. “We will not let the government lie and run away from fulfilling its promises,” he added. Addressing the gathering, Sukhbir said rather than giving any relief to the people the government had introduced new taxes, increased power rates and stopped distribution of social welfare benefits. “Even work on sewerage projects has been stopped. The people have a right to know where money collected on account of GST, excise and other taxes that has come into the government treasury been spent?” The SAD president also made it clear that the party would not tolerate registration of false cases against its cadre and that any officer doing so would have to bear the lawful repercussions. Senior party leader Bikram Singh Majithia said the Congress was running away from discussing its performance and that’s why it had curtailed the budget session to 7 days. Speaking about the recent observations by the chief minister after witnessing illegal sand mining while travelling on a helicopter, Majithia said the CM did not have to rely on aerial surveys to arrive at this conclusion. “He has already been handed over a list of Congress leaders, who are indulging in illegal mining. He needs to act against them.” Speaking on the occasion, former minister and Sahnewal MLA Sharanjit Singh Dhillon said the Congress government was not going ahead with establishment of the Dhanansu focal point deliberately because the people of Sahnewal had reposed faith in the SAD. SAD rejects Justice (retd) Ranjit Singh Commission The Shiromani Akali Dal on Thursday passed a resolution calling for scrapping of the Justice (retd) Ranjit Singh Commission and demanded that all cases of sacrilege during the SAD-BJP tenure as well as the during Congress rule should be probed by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court. The resolution was passed at a rally organized by the party here in the presence of SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal as well as the senior leadership. Moving the resolution, senior leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal said the party would cooperate with any commission headed by a Supreme Court judge as it was of the firm view that Justice Ranjit Singh (retd) was biased towards the SAD due to his close ties with the Congress party. He also pointed out that the commission was summoning SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal when recently both chief minister Amarinder Singh as well as the state police chief had stated that foreign agencies were behind recent attempts to create communal tension in Punjab.

MC wants tenants to buy their old rental properties,9/3/2018,city,"LUDHIANA: Putting up a last-ditch effort in generating revenue through the sale of their old rental properties, civic officials have now started approaching individual tenants, so that they avail of the policy, and become owners of these properties. The policy will end on March 31, but in the initial months, nobody has reached the MC for the same, therefore now they are approaching individuals. The local bodies department had issued a notification in this regard in November 2017 with an idea to recover old pending dues from tenants who are neither leaving the rental properties, nor letting the rent increase. Some of the tenants are not even paying the rent amount, despite the fact that MC had fixed a nominal rent for these properties. The tenants still have time to pay up until March 31. The tenants will have to pay 25% of the collector rate of the area. One fourth payment will have to be given within one month, and the rest will be payable in three annual instalments. In case the applicant pays the entire amount within 30 days, then an additional 5% rebate will be given. However, officials claimed they had visited each market at least thrice, but it was getting difficult to convince the tenants. It had come to light that some of them had further given shops to other people on rent, so it was getting tough to trace the actual tenants in such cases. The MC had a total of 631 rental properties in the entire city. Out of these, most properties are over 20 years old. Civic officials have to recover around Rs 4.5 crore from these tenants in the form of rent, but in case tenants purchase the shops, then there would be more benefit for MC, because the shops are located in a prime location. Joint commissioner MC Satwant Singh said they had asked officials concerned to issue individual letters to tenants, and also give them a call, so that they could come and take propriety rights over the properties.

"Birders fear diversity of migratory species falling in Basai, Sultanpur",9/3/2018,city,"GURUGRAM: The Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) recorded 67 species of water birds in Sultanpur National Park and the Basai wetland, in the first week of March, even as winter migratory water birds start flying back due to rising temperature. The birders reported 46 species and 3,825 birds at Sultanpur, and 21 species and 1,081 birds at the Basai wetland. At Sultanpur, out of 46 species, 20 are resident ones, while the rest 26 are winter migratory water birds, including Indian species. Eight of the species are listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List for threatened birds. At Basai, the nine migratory species that were spotted included bar-headed geese, ruddy shelduck, Eurasian coot and western marsh harrier were spotted, while the 12 resident species included spot-billed duck, black-winged stilt, purple swamphen, common moorhen, little grebe and little egret, among others. The seven-member birder team that conducted the census also reported two IUCN threatened species at Basai wetland — painted stork and black-headed ibis. Some IUCN threatened species that were spotted at Sultanpur included the painted stork, oriental darter, black-headed ibis, black-necked stork, sarus crane, common pochard, ferruginous duck and river tern. T K Roy of Wetlands International (South Asia), told TOI, “We recorded lesser species diversity at Sultanpur compared to previous years. However, we can’t compare the exact number, as formal census was not conducted in the national park in the previous years. The numbers are declining due to the impact of global climate change, less rainfall and shrinking and drying of wetlands. Also, this census in March was much delayed, as temperature usually start to rise at this time. As Basai lies very close to the national park and within Sultanpur’s eco-sensitive zone, we also conducted a census at the wetland and found 21 species there. The number is low, but there is need to protect the Basai wetland from fisheries, as it is disturbing this important habitat for birds.” AWC is part of the International Waterbird Census (IWC) of Wetlands International, and the largest water bird census in Asia, carried out simultaneously across 27 countries once a year. The census is also carried out at other important wetlands in the NCR — Okhla Bird Sanctuary, Surajpur wetland, Najafgarh drain and jheel, Yamuna river, Sanjay lake and the National Zoological Park.

Huda probe hints at scam in online auction of land,9/3/2018,city,"GURUGRAM: Huda has sought a high-level investigation into an alleged e-auction scam after an internal probe found irregularities in online sale of its properties in Gurugram last year. The probe has indicted the urban development authority’s estate office staff for their alleged involvement in the irregularities. TOI had on September 28 highlighted the irregularities in the e-auction of Huda properties in the city, prompting the internal probe. The authority was accused of uploading details of properties on its website just two days before the e-auction in June-July, allegedly to benefit a couple of individuals and causing huge losses to the state exchequer. As per Huda rule, there should be a gap of minimum 20 days between date of uploading of property details on website and e-auction. “Prima facie it was observed that (details of) properties were uploaded very late which had reduced the registration period less than what was has been prescribed,” said the probe report. The report, which was submitted to then Huda chief administrator Yashpal Yadav on March 1, the day he was transferred to MCG, has found that allegations of properties being uploaded on June 16, 2017, for the auction schedule of June 18, 2017, were true. A total of 21 plots were put up for e-auction, of which only six could be sold. “It is matter of investigation whether there was any scam or not. Further it is worth mentioning that all the properties put to auction on these dates could not be sold, but a few properties were sold because against the remaining properties nobody got registration. This has been a trend in most of the auctions during the last one-and-a-half years,” the report says, adding, “Estate officers and staff concerned had been asked time and again to adhere to the timeline and not to delay in uploading details of properties for e-auction. Therefore, they are responsible for such delay and loss caused to authority, if any.” Dhan Raj Bansal, an entrepreneur who first flagged the irregularities, welcomed the move. Bansal said, “Keeping a small window means getting less number of applications, lesser competition and greater risk of losses. There might have been more people who wanted to participate in the bidding but could not.” "

Sources within the MCG said that the proposal for the purchase of sewage machines has been pending in Chandigarh for almost two years even as the city struggles with overflowing sewers. One such incident was recently reported from Sector 12a where the sewage was overflowing for a week. According to few councillors, they have even proposed to the government to rent machines if their purchase is not getting the approval, but that too hasn’t seen any development. “Around five months back, during a meeting with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, we proposed getting machines on rent as their purchase was taking time. However even that has not happened yet,” said Subhash Singhla, ward 8 councillor. “When MCG has the resources to rent machines, why are we sending men to clean the sewers and putting their lives at risk?” questioned Singhla. When contacted, an MCG official, requesting anonymity, said, “Gurugram desperately needs more sewage cleaning machines, especially in the old city areas . We need at least eight machines so that every zone has two machines each.” Meanwhile, MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav has asked the engineering team to conduct a survey of all the sewage lines in the city and complete the cleaning process within two months.

They only need to pay property taxes, as per the existing rates, to MCG, which will, in turn, maintain and repair roads, sewer lines and other infrastructures. “Under the new agreement, MCG will collect property taxes as usual while HSIIDC will work as the maintenance agency. At the end of the year, HSIIDC will have to submit the details of expenditures incurred to MCG which will pay up,” said an MCG official. “The new arrangement will provide a big relief to industrialists, who will not have to pay maintenance charges anymore.” Till now, businessmen have been paying property tax at the rate of Rs 5 per square yards to MCG and maintenance charges at the rate of Rs 14-16 per square metre to HSIIDC. An operation and maintenance committee has been deciding the maintenance charge for individual unit every year based on the upkeep and repair work required in that particular year. Also, a committee will be formed to discuss and sort out any differences that may crop up in future between MCG and HSIIDC. If it fails to come to a consensus on any particular matter, it will be forwarded to Anand Mohan Sharan, principal secretary, the department of urban local bodies. Industrialists welcomed the move and said it would improve the quality of basic services in industrial sectors. “The industries have for long been facing the burden of double taxes. We welcome the development and hope HSIIDC will continue maintaining the areas as it has been till now,” said Animesh Saxena, president, Udyog Vihar Industrial Association. "

The corridor is proposed alongside the Buddha Nallah to develop a secondary transport system, as well as reducing burden on the main roads. However, it is yet to be seen whether it will become a reality, or like previous projects of metro rail and BRTS (Bus Rapid Transit System), it will also remain on paper. It is not the first time that monorail has been proposed for the city, as a team of experts from Tata Reality and Infrastructure Limited had also visited the city in November 2010 for survey regarding the monorail. They had calculated its cost at Rs 2,500 crore. After this, representatives from Japan-based Hitachi India Private Limited visited the city in 2011 for a survey regarding the project. However, all these efforts could not yield fruit due to its higher cost. Earlier, the project was proposed for routes on main city roads, but this time it has been proposed on the road alongside Buddha Nallah.

It added that the complainant herself was not aware of pre-existing medical ailment/condition in question and that is why, she did not disclose the same through the proposal form dated September 3, 2013. “Due to this improper repudiation of claim or cancellation of policy, the complainant suffered lot of mental tension and agony and as such she is entitled to compensation for mental harassment and agony as well as to litigation expenses to somewhat reasonable amount by keeping in view her suffering of pursuing this litigation since from July 2015,” the forum ruled.

'Architecture should celebrate life’,9/3/2018,city,"How do you see the Pritzker Prize, and being the first Indian to receive it?• This award signals a lot of things for architects, planners and institutions. The award speaks volumes of what should be our priorities vis-avis improving quality of life, which is optimum use of energy and time. Planners should pause and see whether their works benefit families across all strata, children, their neighbourhoods and community, whether we have created opportunities for them to frequently gather and deliberate or rejoice so that the community feels that their time has been more meaningful, diverse and memorable. You worked with Le Corbusier for seven years. What quality of his influenced you?• He taught me to value freedom. He taught me to make choices. He insisted that one should make exceptions and break rules that architecture prescribed. Such was my guru, that he could be formal and informal, caring and detached, all in a single moment. In his works, he was deeply concerned about the condition of man. This has influenced all my works, the Aranya low income housing in Indore, IFFCO housing Kalol, ATIRA housing, Bimanagar housing, the Bhadra Plaza, Cept University, all depict an architecture that is personal, how people live and connect, and are laced with sights, sounds, and community’s memories. You worked with Louis Kahn as well? How were they different?• Both were opposite ends. I worked with Kahn in 1962. Louis Kahn loved the sun, moon, wind and the shadows which would hit the parallel wall revealing its texture. He considered Corbu as his guru. Kahn never had anything except boiled potatoes and fish. Corbu loved to savour all foods, he was a mystic. When our cities are turning into an urban jungle, how should architecture be?• Architects, like doctors, should find humane ways of making habitations efficient. The slums, crowd, chaotic traffic have nearly ended that graceful ways of living. Today, architects talk more of marketability rather than grace. Today in our cities, people have no time to stop because planners have not given them spaces for pause and relaxation — public spaces, parks and gardens. Where are the big shady trees where one can go, sit and ponder! While designing our cities, we have almost forgotten how we have squandered away our resources. This should change. "
"Now, RTO puts a price on 'BOSS' and 'PAPA'",9/3/2018,city,"LUCKNOW: 'PAPA' will have to dole out money if his children wish to 'BOSS' around on vehicles. The regional transport office (RTO), Lucknow, has identified 25 fancy numbers which will be made 'paid' like VIP numbers. Reason: These registration numbers read like words when embossed in a stylish way on the number plates. For example, registration number 4141 can be written as 'PAPA' and '8055' as 'BOSS'. Similarly, 0214 reads like 'RAM' when written in Hindi. RTO officials said the proposal would serve dual purpose. First, it would discourage the practice of fancy number plates, and second, it would fetch additional revenue to the department. The proposal has been sent to the transport department for consideration. In 2016, TOI had run a long campaign highlighting the rampant display of fancy registration numbers on vehicles plying on Lucknow road. The campaign had even led to a crackdown on such vehicles by RTO. The registration numbers have to be written as per the specifications in Section 51 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. Sporting fancy registration number plates is a punishable offence, but a meagre fine of Rs 100 fails to curb the practice among riders, especially youngsters. ""Putting a price tag on such numbers might discourage the practice of stylish number plates,"" said ARTO (administration), Lucknow, Raghvendra Singh. In the proposal, RTO has stated that fancy numbers are in high demand and added that people wait for weeks to get them and even keep their vehicles unregistered till they get the preferred registration numbers. Also, it mounts pressure on RTO employees to allot such numbers as there are many requests for the same number. Online auction for 350 registration nos.The state transport department holds online auction for about 350 registration numbers which have been categorised as the ‘Most attractive numbers, ‘Most important numbers’, ‘Attractive numbers’ and ‘Important numbers’. The registration numbers that RTO Lucknow has proposed to make paid numbers are in addition to this series and may not be auctioned. TIMESVIEWThe proposal to put a price tag on vehicle registration numbers that are often depicted in a way on number plates to represent words like &quot;BOSS&quot;, is an innovative move to curb this practice. TOI feels that along with such steps, the RTO -- along with city police --needs to crackdown heavily on those who violate norms laid down for painting number plates."
No ‘nokkukooli’ from May Day,9/3/2018,city,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state will do away with the infamous practice of headload workers demanding ‘nokkukooli’ from entrepreneurs from May 1. All trade unions have pledged their support to end this unethical practice followed by them for years in the state during a discussion convened by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday. Nokkukooli is the practice of accepting wages for manual work in lieu of some work done by machinery hired by the entrepreneur. The CM has asked all district collectors to convene a meeting to ensure this in all districts before May 1. During the previous UDF regime, there were efforts to make Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode districts free of nokkukooli. But, there are still complaints from these places. Vijayan asked all trade unions to stop supplying labourers to various industries in the state. The government will soon come out with a proposal to help labourers who are losing their jobs due to latest technology, he said. Though none of the industries have been affected due to the trade union activities in the state in the last decade, the impression about Kerala, outside the state, is the other way around, he added. Anathalavattom Anandan (CITU), R Chandrashekar and Varakala Kahar (INTUC), K S Indushekaran Nair (AITUC), G Mahin Aboobaker (STU), G Sugunanan (HMS), G K Ajith and Sivaji Sudarshan (BMS) represented various trade unions in the meet.

"When you hear ‘PM’, think of ‘poshan mission’: Narendra Modi",9/3/2018,city,"JHUNJHUNU: Prime Minister Modi on Thursday redefined the acronym “PM” as “poshan mission” and said every time one hears the word the nutrition mission should come to mind. In Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, to launch the National Nutrition (Poshan) Mission and the pan-India expansion of the Beti Bachaho Beti Padhao (BBBP) programme on Women’s Day, Modi also presented teddy bears to the daughters of 200 women chosen to meet him because they were mothers only to girls. “When someone says PM, be it to criticise or to compliment, it is the poshan (nutrition) mission that should come to your mind, and not Narendra Modi,” the PM said. He also praised the district to improve sex ratio under the BBBP programme. “In the 18th century, when a girl was born people used to drown her in a big utensil filled with milk. But we are worse than even them. In those times, those people at least allowed girls to take birth. She could see the face of her mother and her mother could see her face. Today, we misuse technology and kill girls in the womb of the mother,” Modi said. “A jan andolan (public revolution) is needed to save the girl child and to improve nutrition levels among girls,” he said and urged mothers-inlaw to take the lead. Two hundred women from Jhunjhunu, all under 30 years of age and mothers only to girls, were proud that their daughters were the reason they were getting to meet the PM. Modi spent 10 minutes interacting with them and playing with the young girls. “I am so proud of my daughter and so glad I made this decision. It is because of her that PM chose to meet me. No son can give me what my daughter has given me today,” said Pooja Kumari. whose daughter is 17 months old. "
The Yogi and the Acrobat,9/3/2018,city,"A series of seemingly disparate coincidences have marked my life. Now when I think about them, I sense an undercurrent, a binding thread that joins them together. Were these coincidences just a series of happenstance? I don’t think so,” says the 2018 Pritzker Prize winner, architect and educator, B V Doshi.Born in Pune, in 1927, into an Hindu joint family involved in the furniture industry, Doshi reminisces in his recent book ‘Paths Unchartered’ about how after high school he joined a painting class at an institute of Modern Art, run by Venkatesh Patil. Two years later, Doshi joined the JJ School of Art where his senior Hari Kanhere invited him midway through his course to London, where he joined the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). This was the turning point in Doshi’s life. One day Doshi learnt that the CIAM Congress was to be held at Hoddesdon in 1950. “A Colombian architect, Germán Samper, who worked with Le Corbusier realised that I was the only Indian at CIAM and asked me what Chandigarh meant. I promptly responded that ‘Chandigarh’ meant Goddess Chandi’s house”. Doshi worked with Corbusier between 1951 and 1954 — during which his work consisted of the Shodhan and Sarabhai houses, Sanskar Kendra and the Mill Owners building — and returned to Ahmedabad to supervise his projects. He established his studio, Vastu-Shilpa, in 1955, and also worked closely with renowned American architect Louis Kahn, who designed the IIM Ahmedabad campus. In his book, Doshi says how he got he got his first job in Ahmedabad. “I spoke to Kasturbhai Lalbhai about starting my practice in Ahmedabad. He asked me how much money I need per month? I said ‘perhaps Rs 500. He then said ‘If I provide you with enough work to earn, would you stay. ‘Yes’ I said,” says Doshi in his book. In 1996, his dream project, the Husain-Doshi Gufa (which he conceptualised with noted painter M F Husain), was vandalised by Bajrang Dal activists who forced their way in and destroyed about 23 tapestry items and 28 Husain paintings. The gallery reopened in 2006 and was renamed ‘Amdavad ni Gufa’. In Video:The Yogi and the Acrobat"
National SC panel suggests using robots for manual scavenging,9/3/2018,city,"CHANDIGARH: A delegation of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) led by their chairman Ram Shankar Katheria and vice-chairman L Murugan suggested that the Punjab government should use robots for cleaning sewers to completely abolish the illegal practice of forced manual scavenging. The commission also pointed out that many police officers were still registering cases under the relatively milder provisions of the old SC and ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. In a meeting with chief minister Amarinder Singh, the commission underlined the need for police officers to register cases under the more stringent clauses of the amended Act of 2015, which was notified in 2016. This will ensure that victims and their families get higher compensation to which they were entitled to under the amended legislation. Amarinder directed DGP (intelligence) Dinkar Gupta to arrange for the sensitization and training programme of the police officers. He assured the delegation of stringent measures to ensure strict enforcement of the Act in order to prevent atrocities against SCs and STs. On the issue of recent deaths of some SC persons in reported cases of forced manual scavenging, Amarinder assured the delegation of complete implementation of the Supreme Court guidelines in this regard. He also sought a report on the viability of using robots.

Khattar favours all party meeting on SYL canal issue,9/3/2018,city,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday favoured an all-party meeting on the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue. The chief minister also said the opposition should not use the issue to derive political gains and as a “ladder to come to power.” “We must move forward on the canal’s construction rather than politicizing the issue. We should have another round of all-party meeting on it to decide the line of action,” he said in the state assembly’s ongoing budget session. “The Presidential Reference on the SYL canal was pending in the Supreme Court for 12 long years and it was the present state government that strongly pleaded the case in the court and ensured its early hearing,” Khattar said. He said that because of the efforts of his government, the apex court had given its decision in favour of Haryana. “Now, the execution order is to be passed by the Supreme Court,” Khattar said, adding “Haryana will not leave even a single drop of its share of water.” Leader of Opposition Abhay Singh Chautala had on Wednesday, in Delhi, threatened to launch a ‘jail bharo andolan’ on May 1 if the government failed to start the canal’s construction.

This government represents 2.5 crore people of Haryana. We believe in ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’,” he said. Khattar said that his government had ensured equitable development. “Earlier, there was a perception that more development works remained concentrated in regions from where chief ministers came,” he said. “I have told in my constituency that development works in Karnal will happen in the same manner as in rest of Haryana,” he said. Khattar claimed that out of the 4,500 CM’s announcements, work on 3,200 had either been completed or nearing completion. Chautala has sought that a complete record pertaining to these announcements be placed before the House. Taking a dig at the opposition, Khattar said they even tried to make a big issue when the governor said that some part of his address speech on the opening day of the assembly be treated as read. “They tried to give a twist to this as well,” he said.

"Stake sale in Air India, Pawans Hans to be fast-tracked",9/3/2018,city,"HYDERABAD: Flying high on the 20% growth clocked by the Indian civil aviation industry over the past three years, the government is pulling out all the stops to put the sector on the fast track — be it the divestment of PSUs like Air India or Pawan Hans, aggressive expansion of aviation infrastructure or even sharper focus on skill development. The government will be inviting expressions of interest (EoIs) for stakesalein Air India and Pawan Hans “in the next couple of weeks”, said Union civil aviation secretary RN Choubey at the inaugural day of WINGS INDIA 2018, the biennial civil aviation and aerospace event that kicked off in Hyderabad on Thursday. On the government’s big play on regional connectivity or UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik), he said it is going full steam ahead to spruce up airport infrastructure with Airports Authority of India (AAI) earmarking ?18,000 crore towards airport upgradation over the next four years. Choubey also expressed optimism that the amendment to the AAI Act will be moved in the current budget session. “We hope to move it in the current session and thereafter it is for the Parliament (to clear). If the matter is referredto a select committee, it may take a little longer. But if everything goes well, I think the amendment should happen in six months,” he said. Giving a sneak peek into the international version of UDAN — UDAN version 2.0 — Choubey said the government is keen on encouraging states to use the UDAN platform to offer international connectivity and urged them to take a cue from Assam which plans to start international UDAN flights to South East Asian countries by providing a subsidy of ?100 crore per year for the next three years. “State governments will have to provide subsidy. We will not be providing it from RC Fund,” he clarified. Outlining the government’s efforts to boost regional air connectivity, Choubey said much will hinge on oil prices remaining soft. He also admitted that the lack of land availability and land acqusition for creating airport infrastructure poses major hurdles. On the growing requirement of skilled manpower, he said the sector would require between 8,000 to 10,000 pilots in the next five to six years. "
Haryana technical education board to issue digital diplomas,9/3/2018,city,"CHANDIGARH: The Haryana State Board of Technical Education (HSBTE) is all set to issue digital diplomas and detailed mark certificates (DMCs) to its students from the current academic session 2017-18. A spokesman of the board said that an MoU has been signed with the Central Depository Services (India), a firm referred by the MHRD for utilizing the National Academic Depository (NAD) services. He said that the NAD is a 24x7 online store house of all academic awards like certificates, diplomas, degrees, DMCs, etc. duly digitized and lodged by academic institutions, boards and eligibility assessment bodies. The NAD not only ensures easy access and retrieval of an academic award but also validates and guarantees its authenticity and safe storage.

Only the student concerned is authorized to access academic awards in the digital mode, which could be a DMC or diploma certificate through the NAD online. He said that students of 182 polytechnics affiliated with the HSBTE and enrolled in the first-year diploma programmes would be covered initially. He further said the data of all other students would be gradually synchronized with the NAD. To log in for accessing an academic award, a student should either have the Aadhar number or NAD as the user identity, he added.

Vigilance Bureau to probe cement factory land transfer to Mumbai builder,9/3/2018,city,"CHANDIGARH: In what may add to trouble of the previous Congress regime led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda, which is already facing several land-related scams, the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government in Haryana has decided to conduct a vigilance probe into the transfer of around 122 acres belonging to Associated Cement Companies (ACC) cement factory to a Mumbai-based builder. “An FIR in the issue was registered by Haryana police after our government came into power. During the investigation some startling facts have emerged, and the state government has decided to get a probe conducted by the Haryana vigilance bureau,” education minister Ram Bilas Sharma told the state assembly on Thursday. The minister was responding a question raised by Kalka MLA Latika Sharma alleging land scam in the transfer of factory’s land to a Mumbai-based builder, in connivance of some higher ups or government officials during Hooda’s regime. Latika, along with Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta, had demanded probe by CBI into the alleged scam. Speaking in the assembly, Latika had stated that as per the lease deed of the factory, the land could be used only for industrial purpose but during the previous government’s tenure, it was transferred to a Mumbai-based builder for the purpose of developing a township. When Latika alleged some land scam in the entire issue connected to the Congress , some of the opposition party legislators strongly objected to it. On this, minister Sharma, who was responding to the question, said Haryana Police had got some very “strong material” regarding the alleged irregularities in the entire issue and the government had decided to get the matter probed by the state vigilance bureau. The cement factory — Bhupendra Cement Works, which had the distinction of having supplied cement for Bhakra Dam construction — was established at Surajpur near Pinjore by the Patiala Cement Company of the ruler of erstwhile Patiala princely state in 1937. The factory later became a part of the ACC that continued its operations till 1997, when it was closed due to environmental concerns. Around 615 workers, however, were allegedly denied around Rs 40 crore closure settlement amount by the company. According to the factory workers union, around 122 acre lands worth around Rs 2,000 crore was sold on payment of Rs 197 crore in 2007 to a Mumbai-based renowned builder in contravention to the lease deed of the land executed in 1937. On December 16, 2014, a complaint was given to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by the factory workers association for a CBI probe into the entire issue. Finally, on October 17, 2017, Pinjore police had registered a case for cheating, criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and other similar sections in relation to the allegations on the basis of a complaint received from Beni Prasad, president of the workers union and others. The matter was pending for investigation till date. "

German software giant paid $11m to cos linked to Guptas,9/3/2018,city,"SAP SE said it paid 128.6 million rand ($11 million) to companies linked to South Africa’s Gupta family, which is headed by three brothers accused of using their friendship with former President Jacob Zuma to defraud state-owned entities. The findings represent the first time that an international company has given details on specific payments made to Gupta entities. Other global businesses to become embroiled in the corruption allegations include US consultancy McKinsey & Co. Inc., which said last year it had made “several errors of judgment” while working for state utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., and KPMG LLP, which audited Gupta companies and has said the work fell below its usual standards. SAP said a probe by law firm Baker McKenzie found that the German software giant made the payments to third parties as commissions on contracts with Eskom and ports and rail operator Transnet SOC Ltd. Three senior executives who were suspended last year have now quit and the Walldorf-based company is cooperating with ongoing investigations by US and South African authorities. SAP said last year it’s being probed by the US Department of justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission over how it won contracts with South African state businesses. The Guptas, who are in business with one of Zuma’s sons, are accused of using their political connections to win contracts and influence ministerial appointments. They and the Zumas deny wrongdoing.

SAD MP says ‘main party’ has to do more over TDP pullout,9/3/2018,city,"Jalandhar: No ally in a coalition should be allowed to leave and the main party has to walk more than half the way. This was stated by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Gujral in reaction to the Telugu Desam Party’s (TDP) decision to pull out its two ministers from the Narendra Modi-led NDA government. Speaking to the TOI on Thursday, Gujral said efforts should be made to keep the alliance of the NDA partners intact in the national interest. Gujral had played a very crucial role in bringing the TDP back to the NDA fold in 2014 and the senior BJP leaders and TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu had announced the alliance in his presence in April 2014 in Hyderabad. He was the main negotiator between the two parties over seat sharing, and after several rounds of negotiations with both sites, he managed to stitch the alliance. “The TDP has certain demands which right now they feel that Centre is not meeting. It is unfortunate that they are withdrawing but at the same time they are still part of the NDA so doors are not permanently shut and that is a good thing as this leaves room for developing an understanding in future,” he said. “A coalition partner should never be allowed to go away. The main party has to walk more than half the way,” he said while adding, “we are still trying that they stay with the NDA in future”. “Andhra CM Naidu has his own compulsions and at the same time Union government is bound by the Finance Commission recommendation that it can’t give special status to any state other than those specified by the Commission. The cabinet can’t go against those recommendations and finance minister Arun Jaitley has said he is ready to help the state but can’t give special status. We hope some way out would be found as keeping the alliance intact is in national interest,” he said. Earlier in the first week of February, Gujral, while speaking to TOI, had expressed unhappiness over the way BJP was running the coalition but had said that his party did not want to rock the boat. He had advocated “Vajpayee touch” for running the government while claiming that it would be a coalition government in 2019 as well. "
"In blow to Congress, legendary JB’s son-in-law joins BJD",9/3/2018,city,"BHUBANESWAR: In a fresh blow to Congress in Odisha, former chief minister JB Patnaik’s son-in-law, Soumya Ranjan Patnaik, joined Biju Janata Dal (BJD) on Wednesday. Though the media magnate had moved out of Congress in 2013 to lead a little-known regional outfit called Aama Odisha, this was perceived to be nothing more than a stop-gap arrangement till his family — considered Congress’s first family in the state — returned to its former glory in the party’s scheme of things. Soumya had adopted a strong anti-BJD line all these years. Soumya, who was elected to the Lok Sabha from Bhubaneswar in 1996, was expelled by Congress for anti-party activities. His brother, Niranjan, was also removed as the president of Odisha PCC. "
Heavy traffic: Near-miss at Jaipur airport,9/3/2018,city,"NEW DELHI: India’s cramped airport infrastructure has begun putting massive pressure on personnel entrusted with the task of safely handling the growing volume of flights. On Sunday, a private charter (with only the crew) approaching to land at Jaipur had to do a last-minute go-around as a Delhi-bound Jet Airways plane with 70 passengers had entered the runway. The charter plane landed safely on the second attempt. An Airports Authority of India spokesman said the incident has been reported to the DGCA.

Our personnel are under tremendous pressure,” said an airport official. "
Karanbir scored 10 CGPA in Class X,9/3/2018,city,"MOHALI: A topper in his school, Karanbir Singh was a brilliant student and scored 10 CGPA in Class X. Gurkiranjit Kaur, principal of Shivalik Public School, Mohali, where Karanbir studied, said he was quiet, well-mannered and intelligent. Recalling his school days in the school, the teachers said they remember Karanbir being brilliant in studies and always a topper in every subject. Born in December 2000, Karanbir joined Shivalik Public School in Class VII in 2011 and completed his matriculation in 2015-16, informed Gurkiranjit Kaur. Karanbir’s class teacher, who did not wish to be named, said, “I remember Karanbir. He was one of those good-natured and intelligent students who always topped in every subject. Physics and mathematics were his favorite subjects. It is shocking that he will end his life in such a manner. We never found him weak.” During the results of Class X, various newspapers carried the photograph of Karanbir along with others as top achievers who scored 10-CGPA. Remembering the day, teachers said the school had also displayed news cuttings on the notice board of the school under outstanding achievers’ category. The school management also said all the toppers, including Karanbir, were also honoured for their achievement. School director D S Bedi said Karanbir’s suicide came as shocking news to him. He said, “Parents must give more time to their children. They must talk to them as much as they can, so that parents can read the mind of their child and also must counsel them if needed. The exam days are most crucial and we have been reading news of children committing suicides due to examination pressure.” Another teacher, who didn’t wish to be named, said parents must spend time with their children. “In my long career as a teacher, I have seen brilliant students straying from their paths, some getting into bad habits and others taking drastic steps. I think parents must talk to their kids and never leave them alone. Parents must know what their children are going through and stand with them especially in their adolescence.” "
"Haryana, UP officials to discuss irrigation issues: CM Manohar Lal Khattar",9/3/2018,city,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has said that a meeting would be held between Haryana and Uttar Pradesh officials next month to resolve various issues concerning irrigation. Replying to the debate on the governor’s address on the fourth day of the budget session of the Haryana assembly on Thursday, he said the demand would be raised at the meeting for giving control of part of the Agra Canal, which fell in Haryana, for the purpose of cleanliness so that the farmers could get their allocated share of water from the canal. About 100km stretch of the Agra canal falls in Haryana and the farmers in various parts of southern Haryana get water from various channels which emanate from the river. At present, Haryana has to take no objection certificate (NOC) from UP for cleaning the canal since its control rests with UP, the CM said. “During my visit to Barsana in UP recently, I had discussed with the UP CM Yogi Adityanath, various issues concerning inter-state border, law and order and irrigation. It was then principally decided that issues concerning both states would be mutually resolved,” CM said. In order to ensure that clean water flows in the Yamuna and all other rivers passing through the state, the central government has been requested to prepare a plan on the pattern of the ‘Namami Gange’ project implemented to clean and protect the Ganga.

1.6km rail stolen. Kingpin in Pakistan?,9/3/2018,city,"BHOPAL: Over 1.6km of rail kept alongside railway tracks between Katni and Damoh railway stations has been stolen, leaving officials wondering how this heavy-duty theft was pulled off and why.  The stolen rails weigh over 100 tonnes - about the same as 100 compact sedans. What heightens the concern for security agencies is that the alleged kingpin, Shamim Kabadi, is suspected to have fled to Pakistan, and police can't figure out what anyone would do with track-grade steel. Melting and recasting rails is more expensive than the cost of the steel itself, and regular thieves wouldn't have the equipment or the money for this, say police. RPF have arrested eight people from Sagar and Jabalpur districts, but are no closer to cracking the riddle. RPF officer Rohit Chaturvedi, who is investigating the case, said 60% of the stolen rails have been recovered. ""I am not sure about the whereabouts of the mastermind, but our efforts are on to arrest him,"" said Chaturvedi. An RPF officer said they will approach Interpol to track down Shamim. ""It is not clear how they intended to use the rails. The accused sold them as scrap,"" said Chaturvedi. "

"Farm body holds rally, reminds govt of debt waiver promise",9/3/2018,city,"BARNALA: In a bid to remind the Amarinder Singh government of its pre-poll promise of complete farm debt waiver, more than 20,000 activists of farmers’ organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) on Thursday assembled at the grain market here. They organised ‘Lalkar’ rally to mark the completion of one year of the Congress rule in Punjab and warned the state government to implement its promise. In the next step of protests, the farmers announced to hold a massive rally by seven peasant outfits on April 3 in Chandigarh. They also accused the Narendra Modi-led NDA government of misleading farmers with claims of doubling their farm income and providing 50% profit over input costs. The farm leaders equated the Congress government in Punjab with the previous SAD-BJP regime in meting out injustice to farmers. They said earlier the Parkash Singh Badal government pushed the small and marginal farmers to the brink of committing suicides and toeing the same line, the current government was no better as it had dashed all hopes of farmers of getting a complete debt waiver. The farmers asked small peasants to be vigilant as their money in banks might not be safe, hinting at Nirav Modi. They said the banks might deduct funds from their accounts for frauds committed by certain corporates. President of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) Joginder Singh Ugrahan and general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri said the Amarinder government had failed in keeping its word of waiving the farm debt. “We will not let this government befool farmers with lofty promises. Even the Union government is writing off loans of corporates worth lakhs of crores but have not kept even a penny for farm debt waiver,” they said. Kokri further said that Punjab farmers had nearly Rs 1 lakh crore debt whereas farmers across the nation have Rs 12 lakh crore amount pending against them. He said nearly 4 lakh farmers had committed suicides in India in the last 10 years whereas more than 20,000 peasants had ended lives in Punjab. "

Noisy motorcyclists going to hear it from high court,9/3/2018,city,"Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has become strict against motorcycles that have modified silencers for backfire blast. It has asked police for the address, names, and other details of anyone caught driving these noise machines, so that they could be made party to a case. These directions came here on Thursday, based on a public-interest petition for the stricter implementation of a rule against modified motorcycles. The high court observed that a lesson would teach the offenders how to respect the rules. By the next hearing, it also wants the details of the mechanics who modify these motorcycles for the noise makers. The court has sought details of each traffic ticket issued on this count, and it has asked the Chandigarh Administration to continue catching the motorists who play loud music and blare horns. In an earlier hearing, the administration had submitted details of 315-odd traffic tickets issued this year for dead silencers and high-volume music players in the cabin. This data was recorded till February 15. The petitioner, a Chandigarh resident, had submitted in the high court that motorcyclists continued to even remove the silencers from their vehicles to produce a jarring boom that scares passers-by and creates noise pollution.

"Mallya co to HC: Rs 12,400 crore assets can clear dues",9/3/2018,city,"BENGALURU: United Breweries Holdings (UBHL), the holding company of Vijay Mallya’s UB Group, on Thursday said before the Karnataka high court that the total value of its assets/shares exceeds Rs 12,400 crore at current market values and that can easily clear all outstanding dues, including the Rs 6,000-crore loans, with interest, owed by Kingfisher Airlines to its lenders. UBHL is the corporate guarantor for the loans raised by the now defunct airline. The court was told that the attachment of the company’s properties and shares by the ED had handicapped the company’s ability to come out with any proposal or additional deposits as directed by the court on an earlier occasion. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari adjourned the proceedings to April 2. During the hearing, senior counsel Sajan Povayya told the court that in January the total value of assets stood at Rs 13,400 crore, but owing to market fluctuations, their value has come down to Rs 12,400 crore. He said all the outstanding dues to the creditors would not go beyond Rs 10,000 crore. Senior counsel Udaya Holla, appearing in another appeal, said that the ED had attached everything. He further said that Rs 1,280 crore lying in deposit with the Karnataka HC had earned Rs 137 crore interest, taking the total to Rs 1,417 crore. However, the court noted that share price vale is too uncertain to be relied upon. It also said that any offer has to be satisfactory and the proposition concrete to proceed further. "
Govt will re-table agricultural land ceiling bill,9/3/2018,city,"GANDHINAGAR: The state government has decided to reintroduce the Gujarat Agricultural Lands Ceiling Bill in the state assembly, after the versions of the bill sent in 2015 and 2017 were rejected by the Centre, which required further changes. The bill has been widely opposed by the Congress, which also represented before the President of India in 2015, that the amendments brought in the bill defeated the purpose of the original Act of 1960. A source close to the development said, “The bill will be reintroduced in the ongoing budget session incorporating all changes suggested by the Centre. The Union government had pointed out clauses in the bill which were contradictory to other laws or ambiguous.” In its written memorandum in 2015 against the bill sent to the President of India, the Congress had stated that the main purpose of the Gujarat Agricultural Lands Ceiling Act of 1960 was to acquire surplus agricultural land and allot it to agricultural cooperative societies and the needy with first preference to cooperatives run by members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. The land was also to be acquired for government-owned or controlled corporations for full and efficient use of surplus agricultural land, or for landless labourers, small farmers, cattle breeders and others in need of land. The memorandum had read, “ Recently, after the judgment of the Supreme Court, the government is to receive surplus grassland worth crores of rupees. If these lands are given to landless persons, farm labourers and farmers’ families with small land holding in Gujarat, it would transform the needy class.” Congress stated further in the memorandum, “But, now the government of Gujarat is eyeing this land with corrupt and greedy intention, and hence, this Gujarat Agricultural Land Ceiling (Amendment) Bill, 2015 has been brought. With this amendment bill, the purpose of the original Act to protect the interests of the needy people is killed altogether.” No approval yet for GCTOC bill Government of India has yet not approved another controversial bill, the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organized Crime Bill, 2015 (GCTOC). The bill has been brought in multiple versions since 2003 but has been rejected. Gujarat government has also stopped following up for approval of the GCTOC. "
"No move on supply of canal water, residents set for water crisis",9/3/2018,city,"PATIALA: With summers set for a comeback, residents could face a major water crisis as the authorities of the Patiala Municipal Corporation (PMC) haven’t yet begun work on the ground to supply the canal water for drinking and domestic purposes. The PMC is yet to submit a proposal to the Bhakhra Main Line (BML) for the required supply under the ‘Canal based drinking water’ project in Patiala. The state government had already announced to provide canal water to the residents who have been surviving on underground water for many years for which water from tubewells is being provided to them. The officials of Municipal Corporation claimed to have submitted a proposal to the state government to provide around 60 cusecs of water from the canal that can cater to the residents. As per sources, the state government might provide this water to Patiala from the total share of the state. The proposal to allocate the water to Patiala needs approval from all the three states including Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. The officials from all these three states need to hold a meeting and approve the allocated share of water. “We haven’t got any proposal from the officials of the Municipal Corporation yet. There are a number of hurdles to get the approved share of canal water for the city. Under the Bhakhra Main Line (BML), Punjab has 3108 cusecs of share and the water to Patiala will be allocated from this share. But the approval of all the three states is required,” said, executive engineer, Rakesh Sharma. The canal-based water treatment plant project was proposed by chief minister Amarinder Singh during his previous term. The CM after coming to power after ten years announced the revival of the project very soon for which funds were also allocated. Interestingly, the residents here do not get drinking water from canals despite the fact that the Bhakhra main line crosses through three different parts of the district including one from Nabha road, and others from Sangrur and Bhadso roads. The proposed canal-based water treatment plant worth Rs 45 crore will now cost Rs 250 crore approximately. The mega project was to be set up in two parts to supply treated canal water. Water was planned to be drawn from the Bhakra Main Line crossing that originates from the Nangal dam and passes from the boundaries of Patiala. Similarly, the second part of the project was proposed to be set up at Jassowal village, 7 km from Patiala, using around 30 acres of land. Now the project would cost Rs 708 crore under which the city will be divided into two categories with two zones each in Patiala 1 and Patiala 2. Already the Patiala district has a share of 35 cusecs water for irrigation and lake purposes. However, under the new canal water drinking project, 60 cusecs of water will be allocated separately. “The project will be made for 30 years and the water allocation will be done till 2045. The underground reservoirs will be constructed for which land is being identified. The proposal for allocation of water has been sent to the state government and as soon we get the nod the work will be started over this,” said, PMC superintendent M M Sial. "

This year’s event has been particularly bad with no aero display, very few aircraft adorning the static display area and the exhibition halls too sporting quite a few vacant stalls. “The event is lacklustre this year. We have been at the exhibition since morning and observed that the footfalls are very thin. Also, not too many operators appear to have flown in their aircrafts this time,” said the representative of a business aviation company. “The sentiments are very low even among participants. A lot of high-level meetings that were scheduled to take placewithcivil aviation minister AshokGajapathiRajuwere called off at the last minute after the TDP pulled out of NDA. That has upset many senior business associates who had come to the city only to attend those meetings,” said the spokesperson of an international aerospace major at theevent. A senior representative of an MNC aerospace manufacturing giant described the event as a “Sad Show”. “I doubt, if this will even continuein thecoming years. Aslong as it used to be a single event in Bengaluru, the crowd and response used to be amazing… but after the event was split between Bengaluru and Hyderabad, I felt it did lose some sheen. However, the past few editions have been good in Hyderabad. But this year, it looks like a major disappointment because of the last-minute resignation by the minister. Of all the days… the political drama had tounfoldtoday!” In Video:Aviation acrobatics hit air pocket, Wings India-18 stutters in takeoff"

Vacant spot in Dadumajra turns dumpyard,9/3/2018,city,"CHANDIGARH: A spot located in Sector 38 (west) near Dadumajra Colony has been bearing the brunt of lack of a dumpster and has turned into a an open dumping zone with mountains of debris and garbage scattered all around. “Sir, this place was once completely empty. There was no filth, garbage or debris here. But eventually with time, a lot of people started throwing garbage here, due to the absence of dumpsters nearby. A lot of construction labourers, who work at various construction sites in Sector 38 (west) and Dadumajra, now come and dump all debris in the open ground and have not even been pulled up about it so far,” said Devendra, a Sector 38 (west) resident. The presence of garbage and debris in the locality has also paved way for stray animals to come and inhabit this side of the ground, who can be often seen feeding on it, thus ending up scattering the same at different locations. They are also creating a problem for numerous passerby living in Dadumajra Colony, who are now nervous about encountering stray animals on their way. The ground, that was once used by the local children for playing cricket and other outdoor sports, has now been reduced to a makeshift dumping ground which has contributed to the city’s pollution immensely. However, despite repeated attempts, the concerned MC officials could not be reached for comments on the same. "
Mini grid solution to rural power crisis,9/3/2018,city,"RANCHI: A day-long stakeholders' consultation programme organised jointly by the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (JREDA) and Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation on Thursday sought inputs on strengthening the draft Mini-Grid Policy 2018 for Jharkhand. The draft policy, prepared by the CEED, would help in providing electricity to 55% of households in the state, which are yet to receive access to power supply, and achieve the government's dream of 'energy access to all'. CEED programme officer Pooja Kumari said, ""While electrification of villages in Jharkhand has been completely achieved, the figures of the Centre shows that till January 2018, 55% of households in the state were not electrified. The Mini Grid Policy will help in electrification of these households and will be a complimentary policy for the government's Saubhagya scheme which calls for 24x7 power supply to every household."" Installation of power grids is not possible at many places in the state due to geographical barriers. Mini grids with 50kW to 100kW capacity would help these areas get access to electricity which will be generated using renewable energy sources like solar energy or biogas. JREDA director Niranjan Kumar said, ""With this policy we wish to address the issue of rural electrification through a decentralised approach and to help remove all barriers to investment with better regulation of the mini-grid sector, which, in turn, will benefit the people of the state."" JSERC chairman Arvind Prasad said, ""The policy is a positive step in the direction of regulating the mini grid sector and offering excellent opportunities for private investment in the realm of rural electrification through renewable energy.""

CPM’s Bengal old guard passes on party baton,9/3/2018,city,"KOLKATA: Before the 2011 assembly election, which marked the end of the Left Front government’s 34-year reign, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Nirupam Sen and Asim Dasgupta were the number one-two three in the Bengal cabinet. On Thursday, Bhattacharjee and Dasgupta bowed out of the CPM State Committee and joined Sen as permanent invitees there, which meant all three would now be advisory members — without voting rights — in the panel that once used to decide Bengal’s fate. Thursday marked the end of an era for the CPM as politburo member Biman Bose, at 77, ended up being the only survivor from the post-Jyoti Basu/Promode Dasgupta generation of leaders that used to shepherd the party when it was known as “the Party” — with a capital P — in Bengal. Former CM Bhattacharjee, who suffers from acute respiratory problems and is mostly homebound now, has been pleading with party colleagues for some time to spare him from the central and state committees. But party leaders, including CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, insisted that he stay back at least as an invitee, which meant Bhattacharjee’s presence — like that of Sen and Dasgupta — would now be largely “inspirational and strategic” if not “ornamental”. The winds of change in the party, which gave the the world its longest-serving democratically elected communist government, did not leave the state secretariat untouched either. Two key organisers and central committee members, Shyamal Chakrabarty and Madan Ghosh, opted out of the new state committee announced at the end of the party’s state conference in Kolkata. Another state secretariat member, Dipak Sarkar, former minister Kanti Ganguly, former MP Basudeb Acharia, all handed the baton to younger colleagues, remaining in advisory capacity on the panel that they once used to dominate. The baton now passes on to Md Salim, Sujan Chakrabarty, Gautam Deb, who will work under CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra and LF chairman Biman Bose. The new state committee has brought in some fresh blood though female representation in the 80-member panel remains only 10. State Citu president Subhas Mukherjee, 60, is possibly the oldest among the inclusions in the new state committee. The change in the state committee, however, will not make any difference to the Bengal CPM delegation to the party congress in April because most of the party veterans are central committee members. As many as 175 delegates were elected for the congress — the numerical strength being the same as Kerala’s — probably to give equal voice to the divergent views in the party vis-a-vis its equation with the Congress. Views differ within the Bengal CPM itself about an understanding with the Congress in the fight against the BJP so much so that CPM state secretary Mishra did not even conclude the discussion over the combined Left-Congress’s electoral experience in the 2016 assembly polls; he chose to leave this part of the state political-organisational report for discussion in the new state committee after the party congress.

Tariff war fears: 53 nations will meet in Delhi to discuss trade,9/3/2018,city,"NEW DELHI: Amid fears of a trade war, ministers from 53 countries will converge in the Capital later this month to put WTO talks back on track. The global body is facing an uncertain future as several countries led by the US are questioning the relevance of multilateralism. The informal mini-ministerial meeting organised by India after talks collapsed in Buenos Aires, is meant to chart a roadmap for WTO’s future. It will also bring key players, including the European Union, China, South Africa, Brazil and Russia, face to face with the US, which is facing widespread criticism after President Donald Trump moved to raise duties on steel and aluminium, despite some of his closest advisers opposing the move. While commerce minister Suresh Prabhu dismissed the fears during a chat with TOI, he said the meeting organised at India’s behest does give countries a chance to exchange views on the issue and also revive multilateral trade talks, which have been in limbo after its launch in Doha 16 years ago. While India has been criticised for holding up talks in the past, New Delhi is taking the lead this time with Prabhu promising that it will be a freewheeling discussion. Asked about fears of a trade war, the minister said: “I don’t think that will happen. The US has also issued a statement saying that President Trump is for free trade.” So far, 13 ministers have confirmed participation for the talks on March 19-20 with India keen to get US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for the dialogue. “It’s good for the US to come. If we all come together we will be able to understand its sentiment,” Prabhu said. He said it was important for countries to engage and ensure that WTO remains strong. “Everywhere in the world you are seeing a growing phenomenon of creating borders and even countries that have been proponents of free trade and were looking down on countries, which were not opening their borders, are now thinking differently. In such times, we felt that we must bring all the big countries together.” The minister said we don’t want to repeat the failure in Buenos Aires. “It is important for all countries to pursue free trade and WTO must remain. Free trade and WTO are now synonymous but we do not realise WTO’s importance because it’s rule based, its open, its transparent and it’s democratic and participative. It gives equal rights to everyone.” "
"Smelly, yellowish drinking water plagues Palsora residents",9/3/2018,city,"CHANDIGARH: The residents of Palsora village have been consuming smelly, yellowish drinking water, which is apparently mixed with sewer water, for almost a year. This has become a crucial health hazard in the locality. The unclean polluted water that has been reaching the houses in the area through the faucets has allegedly affected the residents living in over 200 households in the locality. They have been suffering from stomach cramps and dysentery for the last few months. Members of a village union group, while talking to TOI, complained that the water coming out of the taps in their houses stinks and has a yellowish tinge. They are which has made finding adequate and clean drinking water a crucial issue. Speaking to TOI, president of the village union Daljeet Singh Namberdar said, “The water reaching our homes is mixed with sewage water. We have been complaining about this since many months but nothing has happened in this regard so far. We had once submitted a written complaint in Sector 37 to the office of an MC official, who had then sent people to come and clean the sewer, but the situation returned to square one soon after.” According to sources, the four-inch underground pipes, that carry drinking water had been laid almost 37 years ago and have now developed cracks at various places. Due to this, when the sewer water flows closeby, it enters the drinking water pipe as well. “I have just now got the medicines of stomach ache and loose motions for my wife. Last week I was down with the same problem,” said Sartaj Singh, a Palsora resident. The local chemist also admitted that the sale of same medicines has gone up nowadays. The gutters have also remained dirty in the locality for a very long time and are in need of cleaning, to avoid any further civic issues in the area. The residents of Palsora village have also held numerous demonstrations against the MC within the last one month. Even though, the MC officials have gotten the place cleaned once before, the problem with water continues to plague the village. The Public Health Department were not reachable for a comment even after repeated attempts. "
Sealed ATMs near station complex land people in trouble,9/3/2018,city,"CHANDIGARH: All the four ATM kiosks, situated opposite to the entrance of Chandigarh railway station, have been lying sealed for over six months posing difficulties for the passengers who cannot use them during emergencies. The four bank ATMs located in the vicinity are Dena Bank, Union Bank, UCO Bank and SBI. The ATM kiosks, that were once working have been rendered useless, after the bank authorities concerning all the four banks allegedly failed to clear the rent dues pending with the railway station to the tune of lakhs. According to a railway official, dues from some of the ATMs have been pending since over two years. Meanwhile, the lack of ATM at a place of heavy tourist concentration has severely affected the travelling experience of tourists, who cannot withdraw money at times of emergency. “These ATMs have been sealed by the railway authorities pertaining to some dispute with banks. But the passengers travelling from this station are facing its brunt,” said Ravi Shankar, the guard at the Dena Bank ATM outlet. According to Shankar, none of the other banks have cash left in the machines, except Dena Bank, which requires constant monitoring. “The problem is huge. Over 400-500 passengers enter or exit the station gates all day and night, on an average everyday. About 200-300 of them expect to come and use the ATMs here and I get tired of telling them that the ATMs are not working. It is so inconvenient,” added Shankar. “Which railway station does not have an ATM? Places like this needs to have some basic facilities like this. It’s common sense. Think about passengers deboarding the trains late at night. What if they need money to eat something from the station or nearby? What will they do? said Mihir Shukla, a passenger travelling from Ambala. According to sources, Union Bank ATM was sealed over 7 months ago, followed by SBI and others. The nearest ATMs are located almost a kilometre away in Dariya Market. The auto-wallahs and rickshaw-pullers have hence started charging exhorbitantly to drop passengers over there. Even the army officers deployed for security do not get money all day. “Many times, the passengers need money with a lower denomination to pay to the auto-wallahs and rickshaw pullers. ATMs are usually the easiest way to do that, but they can’t anymore,” said Irshad, a rickshaw puller. Public relation officer at Chandigarh Railway Station Praveen Dwivedi said, “They have been sealed because the banks have failed to clear their dues pending with the railway station. It is their fault that they are not taking care of their own customers, not ours. The dues are in lakhs and have remained unpaid for over two years. Several notices were sent to the bank authorities before sealing the ATM outlets.” When asked whether Chandigarh Railway Station is arranging for new ATM kiosks in the meantime, she said, “That proposal is under consideration, but nothing has happened so far in that regard.” Immediate action required I had not noticed that the ATMs here don’t work. I had aonly Rs 500 note and wanted to withdraw Rs 100 note to eat something from the tiny shops here. However, I couldn’t withdraw do so due to the lack of ATMs Prakash Swami (32) | Passenger I have not faced any emergency so far. But, it can happen any day. These ATMs should be fixed at the earliest. The railway station should think about it Ashu Shrivastav (24) | Passenger "
