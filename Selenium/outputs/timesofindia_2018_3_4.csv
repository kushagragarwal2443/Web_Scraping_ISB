MVJ students develop a Bluetooth-based attendance tracking system,15.3.2018,city,"An indispensable part of any educational institution is the attendance management system, which, even in today’s world, is often manually maintained and only in certain places, electronic. In institutions that have classes with a strength of around 50 students, taking periodic attendance is not very time-consuming for teachers. But in classes that have 80-100 students, a big chunk of the teachers’ time is spent in organizing and taking attendance.
To ease the attendance management process for teachers, four students from Bengaluru’s MVJ College of Engineering — Gautam Hariharan, Narein Rao, Akhilesh Sridhar and Jason Manoj — have designed a Bluetooth-based attendance tracking system. Called BT Proxy, the app helps in registering students’ attendance and tracking their minimum requirements, which is usually a big cause of concern for students, especially in a country like ours.
So, how did the four come up with the idea for this project? Says Gautam, “The four of us were planning on attending a national-level innovation competition, and for that, we were brainstorming as to what we can do for our project. That is when Akhilesh and Jason came up with the idea of an attendance management system using a low-energy Bluetooth module. The main goal of this project is to eliminate the time taken in recording attendance, and can be used in schools, colleges, office, etc.”
The app, he says, works on the University Student Number (USN) of each student. “Low-energy Bluetooth modules, are really tiny when compared to regular Bluetooth modules, and can be implanted inside the ID card of the student. These also consume very less power. Each module can be powered up by a button battery and can last up to a year. These modules will be given a unique ID, which can only be set or reset by an administrator,"" he adds.
Every class will have an atmega32 module, HC05, IDs implanted with Bluetooth-modules and a WiFi module. An Real-Time Clock module will keep track of the time. Class periods, break and the like can be pre-set as required. “Once a class starts, the module automatically scans for all Bluetooth IDs and passes on the data to either an attendance monitoring app or sends it to the cloud. The IDs have a unique code and will not interfere with each other,” says Gautam.

Inchara Rao talks about being a woman in the music industry,15.3.2018,entertainment,"Music, they say, is universal, but when it comes to women trying to prove their mettle in the music industry, it is definitely not a cake walk. For years, women have tried to break the glass ceiling to reach a point where they are known for their talent and not for their gender. Bangalore Times spoke to four women musicians and performing artistes, who talk about their journey and why they choose to tread the offbeat path.


INCHARA RAO, PLAYBACK SINGER

The award-winning singer gave playback singing a new meaning when she introduced a jazzy twist to Akkamahadevi’s vachanas.

Her Journey: It all began three years back when I met Ramakrishna S during a recording. Since he was working on this and different genres, it was just a pure collaboration with him on these vachanas. I am familiar with vachanas and was always fascinated by them. Though they were written in the 12th century and are more devotional in nature, I thought why not try something different. On being a woman in the industry: I relate to these vachanas because Akka, at that point, fought with the society. There are so many women who are doing the same thing. In our society, women are judged on various aspects and now it just feels good to be able to perform these vachanas in a different way and that encourages me. I’m just trying to prove myself and try not to bother about what others think.

What can be done to change the scenario: Whether it is the music industry or any other field, women must be themselves. Stick to your roots and never try to be someone else. Your talent is your biggest strength and you just need to show that to others"
Mysskin ropes in Shanthnu to play the lead for his next,15.3.2018,entertainment,"After Thupparivaalan, Mysskin has finalised his next script, which will feature Shanthnu in the lead. The actor posted a picture with director Mysskin and cinematographer PC Sreeram and tweeted saying, “MY NEW BIRTH... bless me” (sic). Well, it sure surprised many, especially since it is the actor’s 10th year in Kollywood. Though Shanthnu is tight-lipped about the genre and his role, the actor says that he is extremely delighted about his “new beginnings”. “This is like my first film and I have no words to explain my happiness,” begins Shanthnu, adding, “People used to say that I have made so many mistakes in my past. But I learned so much. This film will be a re-birth for me. I am going to surrender to sir.”

On working with Mysskin, he says, “We met at an audio launch and he told me that I have changed quite a bit. He said we will work soon. I was happy, but didn’t expect much. A week later, he called me saying that he had finished penning his next and that I will be playing the lead. I was shocked and met him at his office. It is a dream-come-true moment for me to work with Mysskin sir and PC sir. The kind of character Mysskin sir sketches is phenomenal... I am certain that it will be a breakthrough for me as an actor. I want to thank all my well-wishers who hoped the best for me.” The pre-production work has begun and the team is finalising the rest of the cast and crew"
I’ve stopped worrying over things which are not under my control: D Imman,15.3.2018,entertainment,"Two decades in the industry as a music composer, D Imman, who comes across as a calm, but talkative and optimistic person, has seen several highs and lows in his career. A proud teetotaller, who has a clear vision about his priorities in life and career, this ambitious musician gets chatty about his journey over the years, the struggles he faced, his concerns while composing music, the challenges he encounters, his expectations from a few upcoming projects and why family is of utmost importance to him. Excerpts:
You have completed your 100th film — Tik Tik Tik — recently. Looking back, how do you feel about your journey as a composer?
I feel so blessed... I think this isn’t an ordinary feat, considering that I hail from a non-filmi background. All thanks to God’s grace and the love from my music lovers. I started my career in 2001 and it’s been 17 years now. I’m thankful to those people who stood by me during the release of my album and movies. I’m sure there are many more to come.

It took more than a decade-and-a-half to complete 100 films. Do you think you were a little slow?
To be honest, the number doesn’t matter much to me. If that was the case, I would have considered my 25th or 50th or 75th films special. But my acquaintances told me that 100 is something special and that I should give some importance to it. So, technically speaking, I don’t believe that numbers have any relevance.
Over the years, you have delivered several hit albums, featuring diverse genres. Do you have any personal favourites among them?
People look at my career as two segments — before and after Mynaa. Though I had hit albums like Kacheri Arambam, Thiruvilayadal Arambam, Maasilamani much before that, Mynaa, an intense romantic film, is vital in a composer’s career. Like how a period film is required for an art director to showcase his talent, or an action movie for a stunt choreographer, a music director needs a full-fledged romantic album to get some attention.

Talking about Mynaa, you share a good rapport with Prabu Solomon…
The film was a break for both of us. Like me, he, too, had done a few films before, but both of us got the break with the same movie. We have many similarities with regard to our music taste. He has a thorough knowledge of what music should be used where and so on. In fact, my favourite songs of Ilaiyaraaja are his favourites, too. Suseenthiran, Ponram and Ezhil sir are other filmmakers with whom I work well. Unlike what people assume, it is more challenging when you work with people whom you are comfortable with, because they know what you are coming up with, and hence, they expect you to deliver something new or different.

Among the directors you have worked with, who all are musically knowledgeable?
I don’t think I have come across someone who has a know-how of music in an extensive way, but there are people who know what music is required for a film or a situation in terms of emotions. I hope I get to work with somebody who has great knowledge in music. I’d love to do a musical on the lines of Salangai Oli, Sankarabharanam and Sindhu Bhairavi.

The USP of your music is its reach among different sections of the audience. Is it something that you keep in mind while composing a song?
I don’t compose songs to showcase my proficiency in music or to please hard-core music lovers. The basic criterion is that my work should reach all sections of music lovers. I want my songs to be enjoyed by those who travel in a town bus and they should be played repeatedly in a tea shop. People term certain songs as ‘local’, but the fact is, such songs have good reach, and there are instances when such numbers have been enjoyed by even those who do not like such genres. Sometimes, I keep children in mind, too. Songs like Dandanakka, Damaalu Dumeelu, Oodha Colouru Ribbon and Fy Fy Fy were immensely liked by children. When they become adamant to watch movies which feature these songs, it draws a family to theatres, These are all part of marketing.

Tik Tik Tik is your 100th film. It is touted to be a one-of-its-kind space movie. Tell us about your experience.
The genre of the film is such that it has some ‘non-Imman’ songs. Almost 70 percent of the film happens in space, so the music had to be very natural. As there isn’t any sound in space, music plays the central role in conveying the emotions. I’m quite content with the work as it has come out well.

You are doing the music for the animation film, Kizhakku Africavil Raju, which will have MGR in an animated avatar.
It is a prestigious project for me. I’ve been in talks for doing animation films for quite some time, and finally, I came on board this project. The first level work is going on currently. This is a project which I’m looking forward to with utmost excitement.

The biggest project you have in your hands now is Ajith’s Viswasam. What are your plans?
I’m getting ready with the music for the first schedule. This is my first album for Ajith sir. I never had an urge to work for any particular star’s film, but the kind of great person Ajith sir is, I think it will be a delightful experience. It is good to work with Siva sir.

People are curious to know whether you will make Ajith sing a song...
To make Ajith sir sing, he should be comfortable first. He has never sung in his career, so I will try from my side, but what finally matters is a nod from his side.

Ajith fans have already started asking questions about whether the album will have theme music or not...
Theme music illama Thala padama? The album will surely have a mass song and my kind of melody, too.

You are seen as a non-controversial person. How have you managed to be so?
I think it’s my nature. I don’t indulge in anything other than music. I don’t have many friends; I do not drink or smoke, something which I’m very proud about. I should thank my parents for bringing me up in such a way. My relatives were initially sceptical about me foraying into cinema. I ensure that I don’t encourage anything in my life which affects my music career.

Your father has been a pillar of strength...
He was a teacher and my mother was a homemaker. We are a simple family and hail from Madurai. We have had our own struggles. A lot of financial investment was required to purchase keyboard, gadgets, instruments, plug-ins, etc. After knowing that my passion is in music, my father ensured that I got the best instruments and opportunities to exhibit my talent. Everything he did for me was because of his unconditional love for me. To be honest, I’m not sure if I can be a father like that to my children.

How is your association with other music directors in the industry?
We have a good situation today in the industry. Yuvan has sung for me recently. Anirudh and Sean Roldon, too, have sung my compositions. I think the audience isn’t concerned about whether music directors have competition among them or not. They appreciate any good song irrespective of who the composer is.

The way you shed your weight was really motivating. How did you achieve it?
The general assumption is that people in films resort to methods like liposuction to lose weight. But I lost weight in an organic way. I should thank both Athulya and Rajesh — my dietician and fitness trainer. I followed their plan for a year. I’m a hardcore non-vegetarian, so there was this doubt regarding effective weight loss. But I achieved it by proper exercise and following a changed cooking pattern. I used to take protein and carbohydrate on alternate weeks and worked out regularly. I was new to the concept of gym, treadmill, cardio, etc, but now, I feel fresh. There were times when I used to struggle to climb stairs. Now, after reducing 40kg — from 117kg to 77kg — I feel so comfortable.


Music directors, sometimes, face situations where their album/songs get appreciated, but the film bombs at the box office. How do you feel during such times?
Yes, this has happened many times to me. But, of late, I don’t worry much about it as I know it’s not in my hands. Another thing which I used to worry about was the visualisation of my songs. There’s no point in getting disappointed if a well-composed song of yours is shot in a bad way. Sometimes, a hit song of mine might irritate the audience simply because it appears at an inappropriate place in the movie. You just can’t do anything to such things. Some of the beautiful compositions of Isaignani (Ilaiyaraaja), too, have met a similar fate. So, I’ve understood that my work should please people’s ears, and that I have to be satisfied if it works that way.


There are people who feel some of your compositions have shades of Ilaiyaraaja…
He has always been a big inspiration. His songs used to reach all types of audience. His compositions have the magic of impressing classical music lovers who are knowledgeable in music and those who relish so-called ‘local’ numbers. This talent of balancing both extremes is something many music directors, including me, try to achieve. But I don’t know to what extent I will be able to achieve it. Another USP of his music has been the regional connect.


There is also criticism that some of your recent compositions feel similar...
It could be because of the fact that films which I work on belong to similar genre. For instance, I have been working for back-to-back movies which were set against rural backdrop. So, there are chances of some instruments or tune getting repeated as those projects feature common elements like template intro song, kuthu song, and so on. Sometimes, the films which I work on release one after the other, and this, too, may give an impression that I’m delivering similar music. But that is something which is not in my control. However, I have reduced the number of projects that I take on this year. Last year, it was crazy — I had 15 releases, with an audio launch happening every month. I need to spend some quality with my family.


Where do you take inspiration from during tough times?
After getting married, I have made it a point to spend more time with my kids. There are times when I have been depressed, though I’ve never revealed the intensity of what I have gone through. But only if you suffer, you will reap benefits. That roller-coaster ride makes life interesting. So, tough times teach you a lot; they make you grounded and disciplined"
One can learn a lot from #O Premave: Nikki Galrani,15.3.2018,entertainment,"It’s been four years since her debut, and Nikki Galrani is already working on her 28th film — that is how much in-demand this young actress is. The last time we saw her in a Kannada film was back in 2015, when she did a cameo in Sidhartha… Give me a break. She is all set to enthrall audiences once again in this week’s release, #O Premave. Nikki tells us about her memories of the film (she shot for it four years ago), her journey so far, and why she can’t wait to do another Kannada film… First off, what is your character like in #O Premave?
She’s an upper middle-class girl, who wishes and dreams to live like a princess. She does not know how to prioritize between something materialistic and love. For her, it’s about having it all. But as the movie progresses, she realizes how important love really is, and the value of relationships over materialistic things.
Any fond memories from the shoot?

I remember that we shot in a lot of places, such as Switzerland, Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Mysuru and a couple of other places. When we were shooting in Switzerland for the song Gari Gedari, it was -5°C, and while the hero, Manoj, was dressed up in layers of clothing, I was in a thin gown. I clearly remember the shoot because I was freezing (laughs). But I am glad that the song has shaped up very well.
What are your expectations from the movie? I hope that audiences will really like this story. It is a love story for the youth and youngsters can learn a lot from the film. I wish Manoj all the best, as it is his first film as a hero.

I will be back very soon. I moved to Chennai around three years ago, so I can’t wait to be back in Bengaluru, which is my home. And at least that way my parents will complain less, because I will be able to spend time with them (laughs).

MP’s wife: Politician’s son abused me,15.3.2018,city,"KOTTAYAM: Nisha Jose, wife of Lok Sabha member Jose K Mani and daughter-in-law of KC (M) chairman K M Mani has joined the ‘Me Too’ bandwagon, saying she was harassed aboard a moving train by a politician’s son.
The recent #MeToo movement, mostly by women, had exposed the enormity of sexual assault across the world.
In her yet-to-be-published memoir, ‘The Other Side of This Life’, Nisha said her tormentor was on his way to visit his father-in-law, hospitalized after an accident. She, however, did not reveal the man’s identity or when the incident occurred.
Nisha said on realizing his intention, “I hinted that I was very sleepy. But he paid no heed. I discreetly went to the TTE and requested him to help me. The TTE said: if this gentleman is anything like his father, I dare not intervene,” she wrote.
The woman said she pulled up her legs and sat hugging the knees. “Occasionally his hand would ‘accidentally’ brush my toes as he shifted position. I felt violated. He had crossed the Lakshman Rekha. I firmly asked him to leave, Nisha wrote, adding that she made “no mention of his impropriety.”
It is not known if Nisha told her father-in-law or husband about the incident, and if a police complaint was lodged.
The book also speaks about those who had levelled personal allegations against Jose Mani and K M Mani, though no names are mentioned. Instead, she has used “Our hero”, “neighbour enemy”, “someone”, etc. The book also mentions the bar bribery and solar scams.
“My children don’t face teenage problems but have political problems,” she wrote, recalling how her children were confronted by their peers on the bar bribery and solar scandals.
Nisha said K M Mani used to pacify her when allegations were levelled against them.
“Only he knows why he is barking. Let him bark. The louder the dogs bark the less a lion feels threatened,” she wrote, quoting ‘Achachan.’

Ambika Pillai: My dogs opened up a whole new side of me,15.3.2018,city,"Till the age of 30, Ambika Pillai was petrified of dogs. And then, for the sake of her daughter Kavi, a die-hard dog lover, they got their first pet, a pug named Kiddo. “Kiddo just opened up a whole new side of me. The kind of unconditional love a dog could give, no one else can. And then I realised what people who are not dog lovers are missing out on! I had missed so much in 30 years!”
A few years ago, Kiddo had breathed his last, and Ambika decided not to have any more pets. “There is just too much heartache at their loss, I felt. But then, one day, I found this litter of stray pups under a transformer near my apartment in Delhi. I had always noticed that pups which are born there get hit by cars. I decided to take in two of them. That’s how Bu and Bro came into my life, and it all seemed to open up again,” she says. “The world of pets is something else altogether. You become more patient and you love more.”
Ambika soon moved to a farmhouse so that Bu and Bro could run around and play freely. Today, no one believes her when she says the two of them are stray dogs. “I guess their father is a pedigree for they don’t look like stray dogs. But they have the inherent traits of both their parents. Bu keeps running away, if the gate is even slightly open and we have to spend two to three hours looking for him. I don’t know if he is trying to tell me that he wants to roam the streets like his mother! The last time he ran out, he got bitten by a street dog, and we ended up with vet visits. But Bro won’t ever step out. He is more like his father in that respect.”

Nevertheless, Bu is a free spirit and ‘’like a butterfly’’ she says. “He is like a fairy dog; he runs all around the place and just enjoys life. Both of them love me to death, and I love them to death. The moment they see me packing, they start sulking and the reception I get when I return is heavenly.”
And the two of them keep each other company when she is away, she says. “If anyone asks me whether they should get one dog or two, I would say two works beautifully in the long run because they will play with each other. But bringing them up when they are small is a real headache. It’s like having twins and I nearly went mad. Now they’re two years old and easier to handle. They’re fabulous guard dogs and also jealous of each other. They keep fighting for my attention. People say don’t let dogs lie on your bed but I do, especially during winters when they cuddle up under the blanket.”

Ambika recalls that they had dogs at home during her childhood but they were ‘’pure guard dogs’’. “They were always in cages and let out only at night. We never mingled with them. Getting to know and love them is another story altogether. I will never put my dogs in cages or tie them up. Even when people come to stay, I tell them beforehand about my dogs. Recently my niece from Paris had come to stay with some friends. ‘If anyone doesn’t like dogs, I’ll un-invite them’, she told me. My dogs are not going to be tied up around guests, because you are coming into their space!” she laughs.

Why this silence about sexual abuse of boys?,15.3.2018,city,"After Class 6 student Rohan’s mother was transferred to a school away from Kochi, the boy would spend some time alone at home on returning from school. The watchman of his housing colony had been watching this and befriended him by gifting him something or the other. One day, after winning his confidence, he took him to his room and tried to abuse him, sexually.
The 11-year-old knew what was good touch and bad touch, thanks to the awareness sessions at his school. He resisted the watchman’s attempts and fled to safety. He wasted no time in informing his brother and then his parents about it, leading to the dismissal of the watchman. “When I returned home, I found that my son had dealt with it well. We are glad that he was able to react immediately,” says his mother who is a teacher.
A few of the residents in that colony are upset that the issue was brushed under the carpet and not reported to the police. “Such people shouldn’t be allowed to go scot free. Rohan might have escaped his attempt but the same man may have abused other children. Hence, legal measures should be initiated. When it comes to boys, we do not always take it seriously,” says P V Jain, a resident, who has filed a case at the Palarivattom police station, nearly a month after the incident.
Sexual abuse can be traumatic for children and its impact everlasting, irrespective of gender. Often, while great care is taken to protect girls, the abuses faced by boys are swept under the carpet. According to the Study on Child Abuse: India 2007 by the Ministry of Women and Child Welfare which was supported by The United Nations Children's Fund, 53.22% children faced one or more forms of sexual abuse; among them, the number of boys abused was 52.94% and of girls was 47.06%.

Ernakulam Child Welfare Committee chairperson Padmaja Nair tells us that the repercussions of sexual abuse in a boy is as traumatic as that in a girl. “We should not discount the shock and trauma of the boy child, saying ‘aankuttiyalle…’ Even if the abuse is of minor nature, the child should be given counselling as the trauma is lifelong. It will lead to insecurity, diffidence and the child may withdraw into a shell,” she says, adding that the reported number of cases of sexual abuse of boys is on the rise. “Recently, a case came before us where the child was consistently abused for four years. When he couldn’t bear it any longer, he finally opened up to his mother. What we need to do is empower the children and give them the confidence to share it with their near ones. Counselling is a must for victims, otherwise it will remain a scar forever,” she says.

Job Zachariah, The United Nations Children's Fund’s field chief, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, asserts that it is the responsibility of the society to provide the right atmosphere to the children. “Hence, no kind of abuse should be tolerated. Investing in a child is to invest in the society's future. We need to teach our children the simple mantra — No, Go, Tell. It means first we need parents, caretakers and family to empower children to say ‘No’ to the abuser and run away from there. Often it’s the close relative or someone whom the child knows who abuses him. We need to empower him so that they would share the details with his elders. At that time, the parent or the caretaker needs to assure the child that they fully trust him and the incident has happened not because of any mistake on his part. Third, the caretaker or parent to whom the kid shares it should report it immediately,” he explains.
He adds that it is high time for the society to stop being silent about child sex abuse. “As per the study of WCD ministry in 2007, 53 % of children in India are sexually abused. It is an alarming figure. Sex abuse is the most heinous crime against children. The impact of abuse is permanent. We need to raise our voice and expose the silence around child sex abuse,” he says adding that one should compulsorily provide professional support in terms of psycho-social support and counselling to the affected children.

Researcher and teacher of law Veena Roshan says any sexual offence against a child will have stringent punishment under the POCSO act. “The purpose of the act is to provide protection to all children from the offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography. Depending of the gravity of the offence, one can be imprisoned for not less than 10 years which may extend to life sentence. Section 19 of the Act also provides for mandatory reporting of sexual offences. This casts a legal duty upon a person who has knowledge that a child has been sexually abused to report the offence; if he fails to do so, he may be punished with six months’ imprisonment and/or a fine under Section 21,” she says.
